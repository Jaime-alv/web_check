# How to contribute

Hi, and welcome! I'm new to this world and I'm looking for improvements in my code. If you have a suggestion, or find a bug, or want to tinker with the script, 
I'd love to hear it!

## Testing

Testing is always welcome, although this project is not big, I'm not perfect. I build this project, at first, for my personal needs and that implies certain SO,
hardware and expectations.

## Submitting changes

Fork this repository [web check](https://github.com/Jaime-alv/web_check.git) first, tinker yourself, do whatever you want with it, and finally make a pull request.
Be sure to include every change you've done.

## Submitting enhacement

You can submit your ideas through Issues/Feature request. I'd love to hear your ideas!

## Submitting bugs

As with new features, this is done in Issues.

## Coding conventions

I'm following some general conventions.
- Functions are lower_snake_case
- Class are PascalCase
- Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
- If you can, avoid using single term variables.
- Use relative paths when possible.
